# JDUtils

While performing JavaScript development, I have written and compiled various utility functions that I store here.

Modules so far include:

- `JDUTILS.at` - array tools to provide added abilities for arrays. Currently, this includes functions to help provide "circular" (a.k.a. "wrap-around") array functionality 
- `JDUTILS.dt` - DOM tools for various operations on the DOM
- `JDUTILS.compat` - Compatibility tools used for dealing with browser differences and difficiencies
- `JDUTILS.math` - Additonal math functionality not provided by JavaScript's built-in Math library

It's pretty lightweight at the moment, but I plan on expanding this over time.

Please contact me via my website ([jdkilby.com](http://www.jdkilby.com)) if you run into issues.

Enjoy!
